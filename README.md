# University-GrievanceRedressalPortal

<p align="justify">The University Grievance Redressal Portal Project is to develop and implement a web-based software application that enables students and other stakeholders to submit their grievances related to the university and provide a systematic and efficient way for the university authorities to address those grievances. The project aims to improve the grievance redressal process of the university by providing a user-friendly and accessible platform that enables students to submit their grievances conveniently and anonymously, if necessary, while allowing authorities to track, manage, and resolve grievances in a timely and effective manner. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the overall satisfaction and engagement of students and other stakeholders by providing them with a transparent and fair process for addressing their grievances and improving the quality of services offered by the university.</p>
